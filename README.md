## DAY_04_MERN

### Problem Statement

* Problem 1 : Implement a series of functions that demonstrate closures to maintain state, such as a counter or a rate limiter.

* Problem 2 : Create a custom implementation of a commonly used higher-order function (e.g., a map,reducefunction) that mimics the behavior of the native implementation.
